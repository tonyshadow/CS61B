All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: No. I have no access to the staff solution.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: The mod calculation in some methods.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: The resize method and the use of some replicated code are kind of ugly to me.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: How to resize a array more elegant as well as how to reduce some kind of replication.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Change some code to be more concise.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: No. I have no access to the staff solution.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: The skilled use of the pointer of the LinkedList.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: The code written within the get method.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: About how to set the empty case.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Write it more quickly.

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: Yes. However maybe you won't hear my voice about this review.
